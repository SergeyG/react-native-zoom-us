* :one: `Emulator is not working`:
  * SDK releases before **v4.3.53571.0118** only supports emulators with ABI **arm series(armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a)**. Starting from **v4.3.53571.0118**, both **arm series(armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a)** and **x86 ABI** are supported.

  * The Zoom SDK has adapted AndroidX since the release [v4.4.55130.0712](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-sdk-android/releases/tag/v4.4.55130.0712), if you have not migrated your project to be a AndroidX project, you will receive the above error message.
